                <p>Article 370: What is Article 370, Article 370 News, Article ...
                    Article 370 was introduced to the Constituent Assembly in 1949 and was intended to be a temporary
                    provision. It was intended to provide a framework for negotiations between the Indian government and
                    Jammu and Kashmir's leadership, and to determine the state's final political status. </p>
                <p>Article 370 was extended to Jammu and Kashmir in 1954 through a Presidential Order. However, between
                    1954 and 2011, the Indian government used Article 370 to issue presidential orders that reduced the
                    state's autonomy. </p>
