Q1. Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border, margin). 
    How does each affect the size of an element?

    A. The Css box model is the model that how css is work on html styling, it's based on a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: content, padding, borders and margins.
        I)  Content : The content of the html, where the main content is shown.   
        II)  Padding : Space between content and border
        III)  Border : is the border of the box model
        IV)  Margin : Area outside the box border

    Each component affects the size of an element in different ways:
        i) Content : The size of the content box is determined by properties like 'inline-size', 'block-size', 'width', or 'height'.
        ii) Padding : The size of the padding box is determined by the 'padding' property and related properties.
        iii) Border : The size of the border box is determined by the 'border' property and related properties,
             such as 'border-width', 'border-style', and  'border-color'.
        iv) Margin : The size of the margin box is determined by the 'margin' property.

Q2. : What is the difference between 'border-box' and 'content-box' box-sizing in Css? Which is the default?
    
    A. The Border box contain content of border and content with the space between them (padding)
       And the content-box is only contain the main content of the document(Data inside content only not padding, body, or margin)

       
Below is a 200px DIV with 10px padding and a 30px border. If box-sizing is "border-box", the total width of the DIV element is always 200px, but if box-sizing is "content-box", the total width is 200px plus padding and border = 280px.

<style>
body {
  background-color:#E7E9EB;
}
#myDIV {
  height:300px;
  background-color:#FFFFFF;
  padding:30px;
}
#blueDIV {
  width:200px;
  border:30px solid coral;
  padding:10px;
  background-color:lightblue;
  box-sizing:content-box;     ||    box-sizing:border-box;
}
</style>
