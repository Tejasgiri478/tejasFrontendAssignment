Q1. What is CSS Flexbox, and how is it useful for layout design? Explain the terms flex-container and flex-item.
A.  Flexbox is the box to align items in different direction in website,
    That is the display property with the different values 

    The flaxbox is useful to show same content in different styles to apply one different devices;
    i.e if we apply navbar to flax-direction:row; in desktop view we can manage by applying its direction to column, for mobile devices, so that we can display same content to different styles.

    The flex-container contains more then one flexboxes (Parant flex) and manage by display property.
    The direct child elements of a flex container automatically becomes flexible (flex) items.
    
    Here we can see flax-conta and clild divs are flex-items {
    <div class="flex-container">
        <div>1</div>
        <div>2</div>
        <div>3</div> 
        <div>4</div>
    </div>
    }


Q2. Describe the properties justify-content, align-items, and flexdirection used in Flexbox.
    
    Justify-content is used to apply alignments on the flex items;
    
    For align-items in this flexboxes we can apply different values of Justify content. i.e center, flex-start, or right, etc.. 
    
    The flex-direction property defines in which direction the container wants to stack the flex items. i.e flex-direction: column, row, column-reverse, or row-reverse.
