Q1. Explain the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts. Whymight you use a web-safe font over a custom font?
A.  A "web-safe font" is a font that is pre-installed on most computers and devices, meaning it will display correctly on almost any user's system without needing to be downloaded, while a "custom web font" is a unique font that is not pre-installed and needs to be loaded onto a webpage from a web server for users to see it, potentially impacting page load time if not optimized properly.
We use web-safe font over a custom font because web-safe fonts are guaranteed to be available on almost every user's device, ensuring that your website displays correctly regardless of their operating system or installed fonts.

Q2. What is the font-family property in CSS? How do you apply a custom GoogleFont to a webpage?
A.  In CSS, the "font-family" property allows you to specify which font should be used for a particular element on a webpage, essentially letting you choose the typeface for text displayed on your website.
    To apply a custom Google font to a webpage, you can:
        1. Go to fonts.google.com
        2. Search for a font and select it
        3. Click the Get font button
        4. Click the Get embed code button
        5. Select the @import option from the Web tab
        6. Copy the code
        7. Paste the import code into the HTML and CSS code of your website
        8. Save both files
        9. Refresh your website to see the new font
