Q3. Discuss the use of <script> tag in HTML. How can you link an external JavaScript file to an HTML document?
A.  The <script> tag in HTML is used to embed JavaScript code within an HTML document, allowing you to add dynamic functionality to your webpage; to link an external JavaScript file, you use the src attribute within the <script> tag, specifying the path to your external JavaScript file, effectively connecting it to your HTML page.
 i.g <script src="myScript.js"></script>
