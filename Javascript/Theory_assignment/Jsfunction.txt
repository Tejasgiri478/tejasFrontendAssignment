Q1. What are functions in JavaScript? Explain the syntax for declaring and calling a function.
A.  function is used to call multiple statement when we use that function on the element of website when we interact with it.

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}

 
Q2. What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?
A.  Function Declaration:
    A function declaration also known as a function statement declares a function with a function keyword. The function declaration must have a function name.
    Function declaration does not require a variable assignment as they are standalone constructs and they cannot be nested inside a functional block.
    These are executed before any other code.
    The function in the function declaration can be accessed before and after the function definition.

    syntax: function geeksforGeeks(paramA, paramB) {
        // Set of statements
        }

    Function Expression:
    A function Expression is similar to a function declaration without the function name.
    Function expressions can be stored in a variable assignment.
    Function expressions load and execute only when the program interpreter reaches the line of code.
    The function in the function expression can be accessed only after the function definition.

    Syntax: let geeksforGeeks= function(paramA, paramB) {
        // Set of statements
        }

Q3. Discuss the concept of parameters and return values in functions.
A.  Parameters are the inputs a function takes. They are defined in the function's signature and can be used within  the function body. JavaScript supports default parameters and rest parameters.
    
    function greet(name, age) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`);
    }
    // Calling the function with arguments
    greet('Alice', 25); 
    // Outputs: "Hello, Alice! You are 25 years old."



    Return Values are the values that a function sends back when it completes. These values can be used outside the function and are returned using the return keyword. If no return statement is provided, undefined is returned by default.

    function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
    }
    let result = add(3, 4);
    console.log(result); 
    // Outputs: 7
