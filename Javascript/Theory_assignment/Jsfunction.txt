Q1. What are functions in JavaScript? Explain the syntax for declaring and calling a function.
A.  function is used to call multiple statement when we use that function on the element of website when we interact with it.

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

// Function to compute the product of p1 and p2
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;
}

 
Q2. What is the difference between a function declaration and a function expression?
A.  Function Declaration:
    A function declaration also known as a function statement declares a function with a function keyword. The function declaration must have a function name.
    Function declaration does not require a variable assignment as they are standalone constructs and they cannot be nested inside a functional block.
    These are executed before any other code.
    The function in the function declaration can be accessed before and after the function definition.

    syntax: function geeksforGeeks(paramA, paramB) {
        // Set of statements
        }

    Function Expression:
    A function Expression is similar to a function declaration without the function name.
    Function expressions can be stored in a variable assignment.
    Function expressions load and execute only when the program interpreter reaches the line of code.
    The function in the function expression can be accessed only after the function definition.

    Syntax: let geeksforGeeks= function(paramA, paramB) {
        // Set of statements
        }
