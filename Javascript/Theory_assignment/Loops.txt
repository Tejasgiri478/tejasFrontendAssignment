Q1. Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). Provide abasic example of each.
A.  Loops is used to print same statement (run the code) many times without writing code again,
    there are many types of loop in the javascript, for, for each, for in, for of, while, do-while etc..
    here we understand each one in simple example
    For : for( Initialze loop; condition; increment/Decrement ) {
        some code
    }
    While : 
    while(condition)
    {
        some code
        Increment/Decrement
    }
    Do-While :
    d0 {
        code that run atleast one time
    }
    while(condition)
    {
        code if condition is true
    }

Q2. What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
A.  The main difference between while and do-while is that in while loop loop only executed if and only if the condition is satisfied, but in do-while first execute do block atleast one time if condition satisfy or not also and than while block executed and if condition matches do executed again
