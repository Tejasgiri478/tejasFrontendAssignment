Q1. What is control flow in JavaScript? Explain how if-else statements work within example.
A.  In JavaScript, control flow refers to the order in which statements are executed. 
    By default, code is executed line by line, from top to bottom. 
    However, you can use control flow statements to alter this order.

    if-else statements 
    This control flow work with condition block by block 
    there are two blocks if and else 
    if (condition){
        code when con matched
    }
    else{
        code to execute when condition not matched
    }

    Working : here two blocks if with condition : where if condition is true if block executed, otherwise else block

Q2. Describe how switch statements work in JavaScript. When should you use a switch statement instead of if-else?
A.  switch function is used to check multiple true cases, we can use switch statement to check where the condition  match else go to the default case 
i.e if we are checking today's day,in if-else the code run line by line and check all code, so slower the execution, but if we use switch function that directly check matched case other go to the default case.... 
So switch is faster execution in compare to if-else
